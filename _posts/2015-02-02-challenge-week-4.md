If Week 3 was difficult because my body was protesting being worked and stretched, this was the week of the uncooperative mind. 

However, despite the so-called blizzard, I made it to class five out of six days. One was a beginner/intermediate yoga nidra class that was (as advertised) quite relaxing. I also attended a regular beginner/intermediate, two basics, and an open level class. 

Two things got in the way of my practice: my increasing awareness of how much time I am dedicating to attending the studio almost every day, and my super-critical attitude towards myself.

Time is a real issue. Since the basic classes are often mid-morning or early afternoon, I have to break up my day with traveling to the studio and back. Sometimes, just as I get on a roll with some project or another, I have to set it aside, pick up my mat, and get on the subway into the city. It is extremely tempting to skip “just this once” so I can continue working.

Fortunately, I pushed aside those tempting thoughts and attended every planned yoga-day but one, when I stayed back from both yoga and a dance class so I could get a few more hours in on a data entry job. In response to the “time problem,” I will set a new goal: to develop a home practice so that I can be sure to do *something* even on days when I cannot conveniently attend a studio class. In addition, I will remind myself that as my strength increases, I will have the option of attending more open classes, which are more available on the schedule than basics.

The actual classes were more mentally challenging than physically difficult. My pernicious Inner Critic (let’s call him “Doug”) has decided to go to yoga with me. He has begun whispering in my ear about how I *should be stronger* by now. (*Yeah*, I respond, *my legs are tired when I hold lunges, but whose aren’t when they start?*). I’ve started to wonder how long it will be before I “get better at yoga.” My response to “Doug” has been to push through each day, reminding myself that my goal is not to be “good at yoga” but to show up at the mat day after day. Eventually, I hope that Doug will get tired of tagging along.

To combat my inner critic, I have started setting a dedication at the beginning of each class and recalling it at the end. I haven’t found a phrasing that I like for the sentiment yet, but the message is something like this:

**“May I experience what my body can do *today* with wonder and compassion.”**

In spite of my little struggles, I am proud of my continued effort to make going to yoga a part of my daily life. After all, I have gone to twenty-two classes in twenty-seven days.

And that’s nothing to sneer at, Doug.
