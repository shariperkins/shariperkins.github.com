Think of how you put on your shoes each morning. Do you do it the same way every time?

When I read The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, I was startled by the above question. Duhigg seemed to assume that readers would have a habitual pattern of how they put on their shoes and socks. I, on the other hand, do not. Every time I sit down to put them on, I put them on in a different order. One morning it might be *right-sock-left-sock-left-shoe-right-shoe*, the next *left-sock-left-shoe-right-sock-right-shoe*. And I often pause to think about which way I’m going to do it that day.

Am I unusual in this? I assume that I must be. My lack of a routine in donning my shoes, however, is emblematic of my general resistance to establishing routines and habits. As long as I can remember, I have thought of routines as rigid and limiting. Indeed, I have consciously *avoided* forming routines. Relative “freedom” to use my time as I chose was, after all, one of the perks of my profession.

Therefore, each morning, afternoon, and evening looked a little bit different. I got up at different times, I dressed when I got around to it (usually because I had somewhere to go). I decided whether to put on makeup or do my hair on the fly, meaning that I rarely have time to actually do it. I never packed my bags in advance, nor did I lay out my next day’s clothing the night before. 

I thought that resisting routine was giving me freedom to do *more*. Now, I am realizing that by giving myself too many choices, I am ensuring that I do less every day. I was (and still am) spending my mental energy each day on dozens of trivial decisions, wasting time that could better be spent on more productive or enjoyable endeavors.

One of my tasks in the coming months is to create more daily routines. By narrowing down the choices I have to make each day, I hope I will be able focus my attention on more important tasks. Chores that I currently have to think about doing will be done without thought, leading to more order and less stress in my day to day life. 

My first order of business is establishing a new morning routine. What would your ideal morning look like?
