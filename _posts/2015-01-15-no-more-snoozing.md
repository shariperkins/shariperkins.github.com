I have a confession to make: I am an inveterate snoozer. As long as I can remember, I have struggled to wake up. Each night, I set my alarm for “early” with the best of intentions. Each morning, when the irritating buzz of that alarm clock begins, I hit the snooze button. Then I keep hitting it. Over and over. On mornings where I have nowhere to go, it is not uncommon for me to “snooze” for two hours or more.

I know that this is an inefficient way to sleep. Sleep in nine-minute intervals is not at all restful. Plus, my habit of having a two-hour-long “snooze” means that I start each day with a sense of having let myself down. 

But despite my best intentions, I for years I hadn’t been able to break this bad habit. I’ve tried taking to myself sternly (my sleep-brain doesn’t care). I’ve tried moving my alarm clock across the room (I will walk to it, hit snooze, and climb back into bed repeatedly, and posses no memory of my wanderings once I finally awaken). I’ve tried putting a coffee pot on my nightstand, *right beside my head*, set to begin brewing at my desired wake-up time. 

That only resulted in a cranky, wide-awake husband. *I* still snoozed through it—and then had to microwave my cold coffee!

If I had to chose one bad habit—and only one—to break, it would be hitting the snooze button. It has cost me hours of my life, and caused a great deal of frustration and guilt. So, having read [*The Power of Habit*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X), I decided to focus on starting each day off on the right foot. I am happy to say that for the past month and a half, I have gotten up within twenty minutes (but often within five) of my goal time almost every day. Here is how I am doing it:

**1. I took advantage of a disruption in my routine.**
It is hard to change an ingrained behavior when all the rest of your day-to-day life remains the same. However, if you have a major upheaval in your life (for example, changing homes or jobs), it can be easier to make substantial changes. I took advantage of a renovation in our home that meant that we had to spend over a month living with in-laws and in hotels. This got me away from my bed and my alarm clock for long enough to establish a new, more desirable behavior.

**2. I picked a wake-up time and stuck with it.**
Although it has been years. I remember from my college psychology class with Professor James Maas (author of Power Sleep) that it is important to be consistent with the times you go to bed and get up. Sleeping in on the weekends is not helpful (though certainly, accumulating sleep debt it even worse!). I have decided that 7 AM is my goal wake-up time, and from now on the alarm will be set for that time *every morning*, even on Saturdays.

**3. I changed my alarm.**
There are few sounds I hate more than the jarring beeping of a standard alarm clock. Like Pavlov’s dog, I have become trained to respond to that harsh noise by reaching out and slamming my hand down on the alarm, thoughtlessly, just to make it stop. By picking a new alarm (a much more soothing tone), I have short-circuited that snooze habit. I am waking up more alert and more able to make an active choice about getting up or staying in bed.

**4. I began turning on the light.**
Sorry, hubby, but for the time being when that alarm goes off, my bedside lamp is going *on*. It’s harder to fall asleep again when the room is filled with light. I’m tempted to get a sunrise alarm clock, but they are expensive. So for now, I’m going the DIY route and making my own dazzling dawn.

**5. I gave myself something new to do right after I get out of bed.**
I’m not sure that this is affecting my snooze habits, but I’ve also changed up what I do as soon as I succeed in getting up. In the past, I poured a cup of coffee and sat down at the computer to check my email. Now, I am pouring a cup of coffee and sitting down to free-write several pages in a journal. 

**6. I’m cultivating a compassionate attitude towards myself when I slip up.**
I am not perfect. There have been a couple mornings when I have, despite everything, I drifted back to sleep. When that happened, I just got up, got going on my new morning routine, and reminded myself that backsliding is inevitable. If I go back to getting up right at the alarm tomorrow, there will be no lasting harm done.

So, how have the results of changing this one habit been? Quite dramatic. I am finding it easier and easier to get up in the mornings. I’ve started waking up before the alarm clock some days, which almost never happened to me in the past. I feel mentally awake and alert more quickly than I have in the past. I’ve gotten used to having two extra hours every day to accomplish tasks (often tasks I couldn’t find time for in the past, such as journaling or blogging). 

Most of all, I go into each day feeling successful. Those are a lot of gains for making one small change.
