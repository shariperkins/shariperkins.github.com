It is hard to give yourself permission to do something good for yourself. If you’re like me, your inner critic finds excuses for avoiding self-care. When it comes to fitness, my inner critic is especially active. *Face it, you’re not athletic,* it might say, or: *Exercising (in a* nice *place) is just too expensive, are you really going to work out often enough to justify spending so much money?*

On my worst days, that inner saboteur gets its way by merely whining: *But I don’t wanna, not today, maybe tomorrow, there isn’t time.* But somehow, there’s plenty if time to waste online, or to take a quick nap.

During my last semester in college, I took a hatha yoga class to meet my physical education requirement. I clearly remember not just the discomfort of trying to balance and gently stretch my less-than-flexible body into triangle pose and warrior 2, but also the sense of lightness and well-being that consistently followed me out of the classroom. I liked it so much that I even followed my teacher to her new studio and took classes on my own . . . for a few weeks.

Then life caught up with me: I got a job working long hours, evenings, and weekends. The studio was not open when I was free. I drifted away, without having formed a habit of regular practice. Classes once or even twice a week hadn’t been enough, and I didn’t feel knowledgeable enough to start a home practice “yet.” 

And thus, even though I liked yoga and knew it was good for me, I dropped out of classes. In years since, I have occasionally taken a yoga class or two when one was available through my gym or graduate program, but sporadically. Just enough to remind myself that yes, yoga really is something that I really ought to be doing for my personal well-being.

In short, yoga is a “shoulda” that has lingered in the back of my mind, accumulating weight over time. It remains as “proof” that I can’t do things that are good for me, meant to make me feel better.

Now that I am looking at my actions through the lens of *habits*—good and bad—I see that my occasional attempts to “do yoga” fell short because I did not create a habit of exercising. I “failed” because I didn’t give myself a fair chance of succeeding. One or two classes a week, much less one or two a year, are not enough to create a lifestyle change. And that’s what I am going to address with this challenge. This time, I’m giving myself time to form a new habit.

I have purchased a three month groupon to a local studio that offers many classes with different levels and focuses. There are even restorative and mediation classes. For so little money, I have nothing to lose by trying, and everything to gain by succeeding. Over the next three months, I will attend yoga classes six days per week (with one rest day built in). 

Goals:

1. Increased strength.

2. Increased flexibility.

3. A space for quietness and meditation every day.

4. Improved body awareness.

5. A new facet to my self-identity.

6. A sense of discipline and the confidence boost that comes with following through on a commitment.

As the challenge goes on, I will check in here weekly, offering updates on what progress (or lack thereof) I have made and what (if any) changes I see within myself stemming from regular practice and discipline.
