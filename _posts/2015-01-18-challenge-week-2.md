Week 2 of my three month challenge has been more difficult than Week 1. Because of my work schedule, I couldn’t attend the Basic classes after Wednesday. However, I was determined to stick to my plan of yoga-(almost)-everyday. While I did Basic classes Monday through Wednesday, I attended Beginner/Intermediate and Open classes Thursday through Sunday, with Friday was a day of rest.

Although these classes were within my abilities (i.e., I could follow along well enough that I could stay in the class), I don’t yet have the strength to hold the poses as long as suggested at these levels. By Sunday night, my body was feeling the exertion. Although I was not uncomfortably sore, I was certainly aware of having challenged myself.

With the more physically demanding classes, I found that although I felt exhilarated and strong, I did not feel as tall and relaxed as I did after the Basics classes. 

The effects of regular exercise are already apparent in other areas of my life. I am waking up in the morning quickly and easily (for the first time in my life!). Most impressively, my balance has improved in Argentine tango. On Saturday, my husband and I found we were able to dance in close embrace with ease. The change was so dramatic that my husband has signed up for yoga, too.
