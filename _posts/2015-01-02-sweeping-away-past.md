In the last moments of 2014, I was getting ready to go to sleep in an apartment a few blocks away from Times Square. Because of the cold and the difficulty navigating the crowds who had gathered to watch the ball drop, I was content to ring in the New Year quietly.

Or as quietly as is possible right next to Times Square. 

Through the window (and simultaneously, via the television), I heard the countdown—*Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Happy New Year!*—and wondered how long it would be before the crowd dispersed and it was quiet enough to fall asleep.

It wasn’t long at all.

But by 5:15, I was wide awake. For a non-morning person like me, that is an unusual occurrence. Not wanting to disturb my husband, I grabbed my clothes, crept out of the bedroom, and got ready to face the day. Within half-an-hour, I was crossing Seventh Avenue to get a coffee at Dunkin’ Donuts. 

Cup in hand, I walked towards the center of last night’s excitement. Times Square was as dark as it ever gets (*not very*). The police barricades had been moved, and the streets were littered with the detritus of the previous night’s revelry. Confetti and food wrappers lay where they were dropped by the people who had rung in the new year. They rustled beneath the feet of stragglers on their way to bed and early morning walkers like me. 

Work crews were busy taking apart the scaffolds that had held the stage lights the night before. Trucks were parked here and there, and workmen labored or stood by with their own coffees. A few onlookers huddled in shop doorways.

Who would have thought that greeting a new year would create so much rubbish? And yet, because of these industrious workers, by the time most people woke up, all the mess of the night before would have been cleared away. 

I walked for two hours and covered over six miles. I went from 54th Street through Times Square, down past Macy’s then back up Sixth Avenue. I passed Bryant Park just before sunrise, and walked through Times Square again just as the sun was rising. I wandered to Tenth Avenue, walked up to the Lincoln Center, and then headed back down Eighth until I reached 54th again.

That morning, I felt the magic of New Year’s Day for the first time. New Year’s is the time when all the cast off, useless relics of the past can be hauled away, leaving only new possibilities. Yet this doesn’t happen effortlessly. It takes the work of many people to create that feeling of new beginning. These people go unseen, yet their efforts are invaluable.  

By coincidence, I was already working on this blog at the end of last year. I had already committed myself to making subtle but profound changes in the way I approach my day to day life. Perhaps that is why seeing behind the curtain of Manhattan’s New Year’s celebration affected me so much. My job is to do that kind of invisible work on myself, to clear away the accumulated habits and maladaptive choices so that the sun can rise on a better, stronger, happier me. 

It is to be hoped that, like the labor of the Times Square crew, most of my work will be invisible to outsiders. The results are what matter most. But on this site, I will discuss the changes I am making and whether or not they have been successful. 

Join me on this experiment. “Now" is the time for reinventing life.
