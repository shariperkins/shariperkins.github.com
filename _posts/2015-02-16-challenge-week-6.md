This week was a study in backsliding. Due to several reasons outside of my control, I only attended yoga three days out of seven. What was notable about the week, therefore, was not my progress but how I felt *not doing yoga* after spending over a month doing it almost daily.

So, how did I feel? Pretty rotten! Within two days, I felt lethargic and blue. I wasn’t moving with the lightness I’d grown accustomed to. I was listless, had trouble concentrating, and had more difficulty waking up in the morning. By Saturday, I was longing for a good, intense class (and much to my frustration, a late train meant I missed yoga yet again that day). 

My experiences over the past two months have made it clear to me how much my day-to-day quality of life depends on regular, vigorous exercise. I have never been an athlete, though there have been periods when I have lifted weights and done cardio regularly. I remember those days as particularly happy times. Now, I am seeing that even my current regime of dancing multiple hours a week is not enough. The yoga helps, and when—in January—I was jogging several days a week I felt even better, slept more soundly, and woke up quicker than I do now.

I want to recapture that sense of energy and brightness. In Week 7, I will return to my former frequency of practice. It will be interesting to observe whether my mood, sleeping, and overall sense of well-being improves rapidly in the coming days.
