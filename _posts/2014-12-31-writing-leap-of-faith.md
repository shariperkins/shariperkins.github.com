If you write, ideas will come. 

So often, we sit down at our computers or in front of our notebooks, and we are filled with fear. Fear that we will not be able to communicate with others because the ideas are simply not there. Fear that somehow our experiences and our expressions are not worthy of attention—even our own. Fear that we will fail, and rather than that, it is better not to begin at all.

Therefore, instead of writing, we engage in a battle with ourselves about whether we deserve to take up space with our pen and our ink and our tiny babblings. Our energy dissipated in struggling with ourselves, when it could be used to get down to the nitty-gritty of crafting sentences and communicating ideas. When we write, we are demanding attention from Someone Else, and that act can provoke fear and anxiety. We don’t want to waste the reader’s time. We don’t want to sound foolish. We don’t want to demand space and then use it poorly. 

This website is about overcoming the anxieties and inhibitions that interfere with living a well-rounded life. It’s about breaking the many tiny habits that we use to sabotage ourselves, to keep ourselves from facing that fear that says “don’t jump!” even when we know that something better is waiting for us ahead, if only we could get started. 

I am writing because—despite the self-critical voice that lurks in the back of my consciousness—I believe that I have something to say. I believe that by writing, I can open a window to a better, stronger, more well-rounded me, and that while doing so, I can provide value to others.

This blog is an leap of faith. In the coming months, I am going to face some hard truths about my life. I am going to challenge myself to do many of the things that I have hesitated to try, from committing to my physical wellbeing to embarking on a new career.

I invite you to take my hand and take a step with me into the unknown, off the edge of the cliff and—hopefully—beyond the self-doubt that holds us both back.
