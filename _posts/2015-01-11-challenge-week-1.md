In the past week, I attended a yoga class six out of seven days. It is too early to note many changes, but this is what I have observed so far:

**1. Improved posture.**

My perpetual slouch is less slouchy, my shoulders are further back and down rather than tucked up under my ears. I feel taller by several inches, though that is surely psychological. 

**2. More openness.**

I have always had a habit of crossing my arms and closing off my body, and while I know this is unfriendly-looking, it is something I have struggled to change because, well, I’m simply uncomfortable with my body open. After a week of yoga, I find it less difficult to let my arms fall to my side. I walk around with my head higher and my eyes up, rather than gazing down at the sidewalk. 

**3. A sense of lightness.**

After class, I feel as though I am floating.  

**4. Muscle soreness.**

Unsurprisingly, I have some muscle soreness, particularly between my shoulder blades. It’s hard work to stand up straighter and face the world.

**5. A sense of community.**

Although I have only gone six times to my studio (and those six times have been spread over two locations), I am already being greeted with a smile by other regular students. While I am a strong proponent of the importance of simply showing up to creating a sense of connectedness and commonality, I am surprised that other regular students are noticing me so soon.

**6. An opportunity to meditate.**

Classes have been crowded with New-Year’s-resolution students, so I’ve been arriving as early as possible to make sure that I get a good spot. That has given me plenty of time to practice some of the meditation skills that I picked up a few years ago and have neglected in recent months.

**7. The desire to do more.**

I wake up in the morning and think how nice it would be to do some yoga. 

I will continue to check in each week of this challenge, noting any changes as they occur.
