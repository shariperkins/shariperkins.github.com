I have gotten stronger. It is striking how much stronger I have gotten.

Between class on Sunday and class on Monday, something changed. Positions that were a struggle to hold in the past—I’m looking at you, downward dog—became not *easy* but *easier*. I felt more secure in many poses, which was a joy after the last two weeks, when I struggled with the limits of both my muscles and my motivation. 

Perhaps my greatest revelation this week was the discovery that I am flexible. All my life, I have thought that I was particularly inflexible, a wooden block on legs. When I was growing up, “flexibility” was measured by one’s ability to do the v-sit for the Virginia Governor’s Test. The lesson I learned from those tests was about what I could not do rather than what I *could* do.

Being called “bendy” and flexible by my yoga teachers is making me question a basic assumption I have had about my own body for much of my life.  It turns out that although I have very tight hamstrings, I am flexible in many other areas. How much else have I taken for granted about my abilities without ever testing them fully?

Once again, I attended class five out of seven days (Three basic classes, one beginner/intermediate, and one open level class). The open level class was particularly fabulous, though it tested my endurance. At the end of class, I felt euphoric. That is a feeling that I would love to recapture in coming weeks.
