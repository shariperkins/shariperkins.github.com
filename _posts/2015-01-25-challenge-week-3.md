Week 3 was challenging. I felt the effects of having attended so many higher-level classes at the end of last week. Plus, my morning jogs (also a new endeavor) meant that my legs were sore and tight. For the first time, I felt frustrated with my “performance” in yoga. I am having to remind myself each day that it is not a competition. No coach is going to appear and tut-tut me for not having a deep enough v-sit.

Since I was concerned that I pushed myself too hard the previous weeks, I took two rest days, attending class five out of seven days. I went to three basic classes and two beginner/intermediate classes. 

On the days that I did not go to yoga class, I missed it. I felt restless, and it was an effort to remind myself that I was taking rest days for a good reason. Perhaps this week I will get a payoff for being conservative last week. Only time will tell.

I continue to feel taller and lighter than I did before starting yoga classes. I can see a difference in muscle definition. I like having the structure of a daily class to go to, since it forces me to plan the rest of my day more carefully. Lack of structure is a major issue for the under- or self-employed, and this challenge is giving me a scaffolding around which I can design my days.
